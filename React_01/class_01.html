    <h2>1. What is Emment</h2>
    <p>
      Emmet is a tool, which helps you write HTML and CSS faster by using simple
      abbreviations that are then converted into code blocks. However, there is
      one minor drawback; by default, Emmet is not enabled for React in VS Code.

    <h2>Difference between a library and a framework?</h2>
    <p>
      Frameworks and libraries are both code written by someone else that helps
      you perform some common tasks in a less verbose way. A framework inverts
      the control of the program. It tells the developer what they need. A
      library doesn’t. The programmer calls the library where and when they need
      it. The degree of freedom a library or framework gives the developer will
      dictate how “opinionated” it is.

    <h2>What is CDN? Why do we use it?</h2>
    <p>
      Full form of CDN is content delivery network. A CDN is a network of
      servers that distributes content from an “origin” server throughout the
      world by caching content close to where each end user is accessing the
      internet via a web-enabled device. The content they request is first
      stored on the origin server and is then replicated and stored elsewhere as
      needed. By caching content physically close to where a user is and
      reducing the distance it has to travel, latency is reduced. This process
      also decreases stress on origin servers by distributing the load
      geographically across multiple servers.

    <h2>Why is REACT known as REACT?</h2>
    <p>
      React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for
      each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and
      render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views
      make your code more predictable and easier to debug

    <h2>
      What is difference between react.development.js and
      react.production.min.js files?
    </h2>

    <p>
      react.development.js is used for react development and it console's are
      open, we can actually debug in main core files, whereas production file
      contains minified version and it is not possible to debug the main file.

    <h2>Difference between async and defer?</h2>

    <p>
      If we have async in script tag the script file fetch asynchronously along
      with HTML parsing. As soon as script is fetched HTML parsing is stops once
      script executed. Once executed html parsing again starts
    </p>
    <p>If we use defer script tag executed once HTML parsing is complete.</p>
